# Active Context

## Current Work

Currently analyzing and documenting the Grix MCP integration project. The project is a Node.js/TypeScript application that:
- Implements an MCP server
- Integrates with Grix Protocol
- Exposes Grix functionality as MCP tools
- Uses stdio for communication

## Recent Changes

Initial documentation created:
- Product context established
- Technical context documented
- System patterns defined
- Progress status tracked

## Next Steps

1. Review existing tools exposed by the server
2. Analyze tool schemas and functionality
3. Document specific tool usage
4. Identify areas for enhancement
5. Plan error handling improvements

## Current Focus

Understanding the complete system architecture and documenting it for future reference. This includes:
- Tool implementation patterns
- Error handling strategies
- Logging mechanisms
- Integration points with Grix Protocol
