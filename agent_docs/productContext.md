# Grix MCP Integration

## Purpose

This project exists to integrate Grix Protocol's functionality with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling AI models to interact with Grix's DeFi and trading capabilities through a standardized interface.

## Problems Solved

- Provides AI models with programmatic access to Grix Protocol's features
- Standardizes the interaction between AI models and Grix's trading functionality
- Enables secure and controlled access to DeFi operations through MCP
- Allows AI assistants to fetch real-time trading data and generate signals

## How It Works

The application runs as an MCP server that:
1. Exposes Grix SDK functionality through MCP tools
2. Handles tool requests from AI models
3. Manages authentication via Grix API keys
4. Provides logging and error handling
5. Communicates via stdio for seamless integration with AI platforms
