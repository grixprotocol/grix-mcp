# System Patterns

## Core Patterns

### MCP Server Pattern
- Implements Model Context Protocol server
- Exposes tools through standardized interface
- Handles tool listing and execution
- Uses stdio transport for communication

### Tool Handler Pattern
- Each Grix operation exposed as an MCP tool
- Tools defined through schemas
- Standardized argument handling
- Consistent error handling

### Logging Pattern
- Structured logging through MCP protocol
- Error logging to stderr
- Informational logging for operations
- Debug logging for development

## Key Technical Decisions

1. Use of stdio Transport
   - Enables seamless integration with AI platforms
   - Simplifies deployment and operation
   - Reduces security attack surface

2. Grix SDK Integration
   - Direct SDK usage instead of REST API
   - Leverages SDK's type safety
   - Simplified authentication handling

3. Error Management
   - Comprehensive error catching
   - Structured error responses
   - Process exit on fatal errors

## Architecture Principles

1. Single Responsibility
   - Each tool handles one specific Grix operation
   - Clear separation between MCP and Grix logic

2. Type Safety
   - Strong TypeScript typing throughout
   - Schema validation for all operations

3. Reliability
   - Error handling at all levels
   - Graceful degradation
   - Process monitoring
